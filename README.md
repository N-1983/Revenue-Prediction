# Revenue-Prediction
The file “data_scientist_intern_revenue_model.csv” contains data on 27k companies. For each
company there is historical revenue data for the period 2015-2019 and historical employee data
for 2017-2020 (beware that there are missing values). You need to create a regression, random
forest, or neural network model, which accurately predicts the revenue figure for each company
for 2020, based on the historical data.
